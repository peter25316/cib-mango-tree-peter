    "## Step: Isolate and Prepare Post Timestamp (created_at) Column\n",
    "**Why are we doing this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus: Our goal is time series analysis, specifically looking for patterns in when posts occur. The created_at column contains this crucial time information. Isolating it removes irrelevant data (like post content, usernames, etc.) for this specific analysis, making the process cleaner and more efficient. We rename it to post_timestamp simply for clarity and consistency with your proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Data Type: Computers need to understand that the values in this column represent points in time, not just sequences of characters (strings) or numbers. Time series analysis functions (like plotting over time, calculating autocorrelations, or aggregating by hour/day) require the data to be in a specific datetime format. If the data is currently a string (e.g., \"2023-10-27 10:30:00\") or a number (e.g., a Unix timestamp like 1698399000), we must convert it so the software can perform time-based calculations correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does this affect the next step?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enables Time-Based Operations: Once the post_timestamp column is in the correct datetime format, we can perform essential time series operations. The very next step in your Week 1 plan is Initial Time-Series Diagnostics. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: Plotting the number of posts over time (e.g., posts per hour or day). This requires the datetime type to correctly order and space the data points on the time axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: To perform burst detection or plot posts-per-hour, we need to group the data by time intervals (hour, minute, day). This aggregation relies heavily on the datetime data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ACF Calculation: Calculating the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) involves comparing the time series with lagged versions of itself. This inherently requires the data to be ordered correctly by time, which the datetime format ensures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation for Modeling: All subsequent analysis, including Burst Detection and Temporal Clustering (which involves extracting features like hour-of-day ), fundamentally depends on having accurate and usable timestamp data. Getting this step right is crucial for the validity of all future results."

    "\n",
    "- Seasonality: There's a very strong, repeating pattern within each day (or possibly every 24 hours). Activity peaks and then drops significantly, suggesting daily seasonality . People likely post more during certain hours and less during others (e.g., overnight). There might be a weaker weekly pattern too, but the daily one dominates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anomalies/Bursts: There is a particularly large spike in activity around February 13th. This peak is noticeably higher than the typical daily peaks, making it a candidate for a \"burst\"  that our burst detection algorithm might identify later. Other peaks around Jan 29/30 and Feb 4 also stand out, though less dramatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Variance: The size of the fluctuations (variance) might be slightly larger during the periods of highest activity (like Feb 13th), which could suggest the variance isn't perfectly constant. We'll keep this in mind."

    "**Why do this?** While our eyes see patterns, the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) provides a statistical measure of how correlated the time series is with lagged versions of itself . It helps us objectively confirm if the patterns we see are statistically significant or just random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- onfirming Patterns: Significant correlations at specific lags confirm the presence of non-random patterns like seasonality or cycles. For example, strong daily seasonality should show high correlation at lags 24, 48, 72, etc. (hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checking for White Noise: If no lags (except lag 0) show significant correlation, the series might be \"white noise\" – purely random and unpredictable . Our plot clearly isn't white noise, but ACF confirms this statistically.\n",

    "- Validation for Modeling: Confirming significant autocorrelation validates that the time series contains predictable patterns, making it suitable for modeling (like burst detection).\n",

    "- Identifying Seasonality: The lags with significant spikes in the ACF plot pinpoint the period of seasonality (e.g., a spike at lag 24 confirms the 24-hour pattern). This is crucial information for later modeling steps, especially if we were to use seasonal models like SARIMA.\n",

    "The ACF plot provides strong statistical confirmation of the patterns we saw in the previous visualization:\n",

    "- Not White Noise: The plot shows many lags with correlation spikes far outside the blue confidence interval. This confirms the time series is not random noise and contains significant, predictable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong Daily Seasonality: There are very prominent, significant positive spikes at lags 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168. This is a classic signature of a strong 24-hour (daily) seasonal pattern. It means the number of posts at any given hour is highly correlated with the number of posts 24 hours prior (and 48 hours prior, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Within-Day Correlation: The lags between the daily spikes (e.g., lags 1-23) also show a pattern. The correlation starts high and positive (lag 1) and then dips, indicating that posting activity in one hour is also related to the activity in the immediately preceding and following hours.\n",

    "**3. Transformation (Checking Variance)**\n",
    "**Why do this?** This is the final diagnostic step for Week 1, as mentioned in your proposal. Many time-series models (and statistical tests) perform best when the variance of the data (the \"spread\" or \"volatility\") is constant over time (a property called homoscedasticity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our visual plot suggested that the variance might increase when the posting level increases (this is heteroscedasticity ). If this is the case, applying a mathematical transformation, such as a logarithm (log(y_t)), can help stabilize the variance, making the patterns cleaner and the model more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does this affect the next step?** If we find the variance is unstable, we should apply a log transformation to our post_count data. All subsequent analysis (like Burst Detection in Week 2) would then be performed on this transformed data (log(post_count)) rather than the raw counts. If the variance looks stable, we can proceed with the raw post_count data."

The fluctuations during normal periods (e.g., Feb 5-10) are small (maybe 0-150), while the fluctuations during the major spike on Feb 13 are massive (from a low base to over 600). This difference in scale can skew the results of statistical models.\n",

The posts_per_hour_with_bursts DataFrame, which we created specifically for this, has the burst_level column. We will use this column to color-code the plot, clearly highlighting the periods of anomalous activity. After this, the burst detection portion is complete, and we can move on to Week 3 with a clean slate."
